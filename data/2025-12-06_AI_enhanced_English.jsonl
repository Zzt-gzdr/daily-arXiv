ASCII art, a symbolic medium where characters encode structure and form, provides a unique probe of this limitation. We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance. These findings position ASCII art as a stress test for multimodal representations and motivate the development of new embedding methods or evaluation metrics tailored to symbolic visual modalities.

The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures.

We propose reward-privileged world model distillation, a two-stage framework in which a teacher DreamerV3-style agent is first trained with a dense privileged reward, and only its latent dynamics are distilled into a student trained solely on sparse task rewards. Teacher and student share the same observation space (semantic bird's-eye-view images); privileged information enters only through the teacher's reward, and the student does not imitate the teacher's actions or value estimates. Instead, the student's world model is regularized to match the teacher's latent dynamics while its policy is learned from scratch on sparse success/failure signals. In CARLA lane-following and overtaking benchmarks, sparse-reward students outperform both dense-reward teachers and sparse-from-scratch baselines. On unseen lane-following routes, reward-privileged distillation improves success by about 23 percent relative to the dense teacher while maintaining comparable or better safety. On overtaking, students retain near-perfect performance on training routes and achieve up to a 27x improvement in success on unseen routes, with improved lane keeping.

These vehicles have limited processing capability and payload capacity, which makes advanced deep learning methods and heavy sensors impractical. Flying insects, such as bees, achieve remarkable landings with minimal neural and sensory resources, relying heavily on optical flow. By regulating flow divergence, a measure of vertical velocity divided by height, they perform smooth landings in which velocity and height decay exponentially together. However, adapting this bio-inspired strategy for spacecraft landings on sloped terrain presents two key challenges: global flow-divergence estimates obscure terrain inclination, and the nonlinear nature of divergence-based control can lead to instability when using conventional controllers. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy that leverages two distinct local flow divergence estimates to regulate both thrust and attitude during vertical landings. The control law is formulated based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion to handle the nonlinear flow divergence. The thrust control ensures a smooth vertical descent by keeping a constant average of the local flow divergence estimates, while the attitude control aligns the vehicle with the inclined surface at touchdown by exploiting their difference. The approach is evaluated in numerical simulations using a simplified 2D spacecraft model across varying slopes and divergence setpoints. Results show that regulating the average divergence yields stable landings with exponential decay of velocity and height, and using the divergence difference enables effective alignment with inclined terrain.

However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL.

To address these limitations, we introduce RoboBPP, a benchmarking system designed for robotic online bin packing. RoboBPP integrates a physics-based simulator to assess physical feasibility. In our simulation environment, we introduce a robotic arm and boxes at real-world scales to replicate real industrial packing workflows. By simulating conditions that arise in real industrial applications, we ensure that evaluated algorithms are practically deployable. In addition, prior studies often rely on synthetic datasets whose distributions differ from real-world industrial data. To address this issue, we collect three datasets from real industrial workflows, including assembly-line production, logistics packing, and furniture manufacturing. The benchmark comprises three carefully designed test settings and extends existing evaluation metrics with new metrics for structural stability and operational safety. We design a scoring system and derive a range of insights from the evaluation results. RoboBPP is fully open-source and is equipped with visualization tools and an online leaderboard, providing a reproducible and extensible foundation for future research and industrial applications (https://robot-bin-packing-benchmark.github.io).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios.

Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly.

This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens.

We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails.

Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP.

In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains.

To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis.

Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution.

The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods.

While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them.

This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes.

Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input. We show that RARL is Probably Approximately Correct, it converges in a polynomial number of samples, and it is robust to inaccuracies in the abstraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, like most of the literature with theoretical guarantees for gradient-based optimization, their results rely on strong assumptions on the function class including convexity and smoothness which do not hold in typical applications. In this work, we develop novel analytical tools for provably tuning hyperparameters in gradient-based algorithms that apply to non-convex and non-smooth functions. We obtain matching sample complexity bounds for learning the step-size in gradient descent shown for smooth, convex functions in prior work (up to logarithmic factors) but for a much broader class of functions. Our analysis applies to gradient descent on neural networks with commonly used activation functions (including ReLU, sigmoid and tanh).

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences.
